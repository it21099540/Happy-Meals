## Description

“Happymeal Food Ordering Mobile Application” is an android app that provides a single 
platform for customers’ orders and deliveries. It is a real-world mobile application that 
helps customers to place orders. 
• The features of our system are an online menu with multiple food varieties, and easy 
access for the customers to place and receive orders. The application represents an 
interactive and up-to-date menu with all options available in an easy-to-use manner. 
With the pandemic situation created by the COVID outbreak, most people prefer to get 
their items delivered to them, then waiting in queues with more people in the shops. 
This “Happymeal Food Ordering Mobile Application” has been developed to override 
these problems and this app is also supported to eliminate and, in some cases, reduce 
the problems faced by the current manual system. Moreover, this app is designed for 
the need of the restaurant to carry out their operations in a smooth and effective 
manner.
• Customers can choose one or more orders from the app and after ordering customer will 
land on the cart option and then to the checkout. 
• This application will have an Admin login where the admin can operate the whole app 
and all details of customers, food menus, and delivery persons. Admin can Update, Add 
and Delete information. 
• This application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while using this app and 
when a user is performing some invalid operations or entering invalid data, the app will 
notify the user about that via error messages. No special knowledge of IT is needed for 
the use of this app. 
• This is made in a very user-friendly and simple manner. This app can lead to error-free, 
secure, reliable, and well updated fast service for the customers
